# FolderToHTML

(C)opyright 2010-2011 Hanns Holger Rutz. This is in the public domain.

A simple command line tool to create an HTML index for a given folder. No thrills.

This builds with sbt 0.11.3 against Scala 2.9.2 / Java SE 6.

To run the executable:

    $ sbt
    > run -C <targetFolderToIndex> [-f <htmlIndexFile>]
