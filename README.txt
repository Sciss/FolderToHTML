FolderToHTML (C)opyright 2010-2011 Hanns Holger Rutz. This is in the public domain.

A simple command line tool to create an HTML index for a given folder. No thrills.

This builds with sbt 0.7 against Scala 2.9.1 / Java SE 6. An IDEA 9 project file is included.

To run the executable:

$ sbt
> run -C <targetFolderToIndex> [-f <htmlIndexFile>]

THIS SOFTWARE COMES AS IS, ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT WARRANTIES. USE AT OWN RISK.
