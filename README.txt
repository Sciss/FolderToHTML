FolderToHTML (C)opyright 2010 Hanns Holger Rutz. This is in the public domain.

A simple command line tool to create an HTML index for a given folder. No thrills.

This builds against Scala 2.8 BETA / Java SE 6. An IDEA 9 project file is included.

To run the executable:

./FolderToHTML.sh -C <targetFolderToIndex> [-f <locationOfIndexFile>]

THIS SOFTWARE COMES AS IS, ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT WARRANTIES. USE AT OWN RISK.
